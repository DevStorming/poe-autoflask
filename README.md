# poe-autoflask
AutoHotKey script for autoflask utility in Path of Exile.  
*Disclaimer: As with any script, use this at your own risk! The script is generally safe as long as you use the default delay values.*

How does this script work?
----
This autoflask script does not require you to input flask timer, instead it works by scanning your screen to find the duration left on your flask effects. The flasks will be automatically activated while you are in combat and when the flask effects are finished; this results in a 100% flask uptime during combat. The keypresses are delayed a random duration to emulate human behaviour.

How do I run it?
----
Download and install AutoHotKey from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/ (current version or V2 Alpha will work)  
Download the ahk file from this repo and run the script.

OR

*Note: You will not be able to make any configurations to keybinds if you go with this option.*  
Download the precompiled executable and run the script without installing AutoHotKey.
